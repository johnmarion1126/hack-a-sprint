# Fork
Forking is another method to test features on a project without affecting the original code. It's used a lot for Open Source softwares where other developers are free to contribute to the project. In this section, we'll go over how you can do this yourselves.<br>

1. First, before forking a repo, we need to decide on what we need to edit or fix. This can be a bug we found, any improvements we want to implement, or maybe just an issue that we want to fix. For this example, we're fixing an issue.<br>

2. Once we have our issue, we have to ask one of the maintainers of the repo to assign the issue to us. This helps inform others that the issue is already being worked on.<br>

3. After that, we can then fork the repo using the fork button.<br>

4. It should now say "forked from" on the top left.<br>

5. If it does, then we are free to pull the repo to our local machine, add the necessary changes, and push to github. For my changes, I just added more text in the README.md file.<br>

6. Next, we can do a pull request to add our changes to the main repo.<br>

7. You can use a similar format like this. Always remember to refer to the issue number in the pull request.<br>

8. The pull request should now look like this.<br>

Perfect! Now we wait for the code reviews from the maintainers or, if we're lucky, it gets merge without any trouble.
