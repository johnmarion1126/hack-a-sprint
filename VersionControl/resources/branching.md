# Branching
Git branch allows us to test new features without affecting the main branch directly. In this guide, we'll break down the steps to create a branch and save it's contents.

1. Copy the git link (shown by the picture) and clone it to your computer bu running “git clone <git_link>”. You can use either HTTPS or SSH to do this.<br>

2. Move to the new directory with "cd <project_name>.<br>

3. To create a new branch, use “git branch <branch_name>”.<br>

4. Call “git branch” to check if the new branch has been created.<br>

5. Switch to the new branch with “git checkout <branch_name>”. (git switch also works here if you prefer that)<br>

6. Now, we’ll make a small change to the README.md to showcase how to push your new branch to github.<br>

7. Using git status, we can check what we changed.<br>

8. To add and commit the changes, we call “git add <file_name>” then “git commit <file_name> -m <message>".<br>

9. If you call git status again, we can now see that our recent changes have been committed.<br>

10. Now we can push our local branch to the repo using “git push --set-upstream origin <branch_name>”.<br>

11. If you now refresh the repo in github, you should see this message.<br>

If you do, then you have successfully made a new branch!<br>
Make sure to periodically pull in your main branch to get any updates from your team.
