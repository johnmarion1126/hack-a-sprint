# Hack-A-Sprint

## Introduction

Hack-A-Sprint is a club where developers can come together and learn web development through building projects. These projects are relaxed and non-competitive so you can go on your own pace and experiment with other tools without the stress of a due date or evaluation. 

## How does it benefit you?

Hack-A-Sprint will help you gain knowledge about basic web development subjects and give you the experience on working with a team. You will gain a better understanding of version control and how to work with other peoples' code. We hope that after doing one or two projects, you will gain enough confidence to tackle the hackathons or other projects or prospects that you might have.

## How does it work?

Your goal is to finish a working product based on the theme of the challenge.

1. Every challenge spans from 3-4 weeks where each week has a number of tasks that we do for the specific week.
2. In the first week, We'll present the application that we will be creating and give out the first set of tasks.
3. Your team will then start building the project and work on those tasks as best as you can.
4. In the next 2-3 weeks, we'll meet up again to have a stand-up meeting where teams can demo their progress or ask for help. We'll give out the next set of tasks at the end of those meetings.
5. In the last week or when participants feel that their projects are finished, they can submit and share their work in a LinkedIn post. Make sure to:
    - Write about what you did
    - Tag @Mintbean
    - Paste a link to your repo on Github
5. You will then share that LinkedIn post in the server's show-off channel.

## Resources

If you get stuck with any part of the challenge or have any questions, ask in the discussions channel or message any of the leads.
