Resources for frameworks and other tools

## Front-End
---
### React
* [Fullstack Open:](https://fullstackopen.com/en) Get up and running with React with this free React tutorial. Part 1 and 2 (a, c, e) are enough to help you with this project. This course uses Hooks to teach React concepts.
* [Learn React for free](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) Highly interactive and allows you to write code on the same screen as the tutorials. The course does use class components rather than functional components, but it can be a good practice to convert the projects to use functional components instead.
* [React Hooks Documentation](https://blog.ohansemmanuel.com/react-hooks-documentation-easy-to-read/) `useEffect` and `useState` are the ones you'll be using the most, but the other hooks are useful as well. 
### Next.js
* [Data Fetching with Next.js](https://youtu.be/f1rF9YKm1Ms) Quick overview of Next.js and its features.
### SASS
* [Sass Basics](https://sass-lang.com/guide) Documentation from the main website. Short and straight to the point.
