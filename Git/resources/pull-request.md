# Pull Request
Before any code is merged to the main, it first needs to be reviewed and we do this through a pull request. If the code is acceptable and there are no errors then the branch will be merged. If not, then the code might need improvement and your reviewer will tell you that under your pull request. In this section, we'll go over how to make a pull request and give an example on how to format it.

1. First, go to your branch in github and click on the "Compare & Pull Request".<br>

2. You should now be in this page. <br>

3. Change the title of the pull request to your branch name. Make sure it's descriptive and relates to the changes.<br>

4. Now we can tackle the description. Here's a basic layout of something you can do.<br>

5. Once that's all filled out. We can now click on the "Create Pull Request". It should now look like this.<br>

You have now created a pull request! Hopefully it gets approved and is merged to main.
